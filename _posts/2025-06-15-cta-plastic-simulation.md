title: "Thermo- and Mechanical Property Prediction of Amorphous Cellulose Triacetate Plastics"
---

I’m a postdoc specializing in MD simulations of glycomaterials. This post outlines how I simulated a cellulose triacetate 100-mer in vacuum to explore amorphous collapse behavior, restrained puckering, and stress–strain analysis.

## Goals
- Simulate CTA collapse in vacuum
- Preserve sugar puckering with torsion restraints
- Use CPPTRAJ to extract mechanical trends

## Method
[ ... etc ... ]
