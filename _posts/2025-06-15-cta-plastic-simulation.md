Thermoplastics have become some of the most widely used and indispensable materials in the modern world, forming the backbone of countless products across industries. They are used in everything from medical implants and drug delivery systems to toys, textiles, packaging, automotive parts, building materials, and even military-grade composites. As global plastic consumption continues to rise with a growing population, the need for renewable, sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics has become more urgent than ever. 

Fortunately, natural and engineered polysaccharides offer a vast and versatile feedstock for designing next-generation thermoplastics. Some, like cellulose triacetate (CTA), have already demonstrated real-world potential â€” CTA, for example, was used in the production of LEGO bricks for decades. However, synthesizing novel glycomaterials with defined chemical structure remains a significant challenge. The high density of chemically similar hydroxyl groups across the polysaccharide backbone complicates selective substitution using traditional protecting group strategies. As a result, computational approaches that can predict material properties and guide substitution patterns are invaluable for narrowing the design space and accelerating the development of sustainable glycomaterial thermoplastics.
