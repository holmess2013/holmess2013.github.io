Hi, I’m Sam, a computational chemist and postdoctoral researcher exploring molecular simulations for sustainable materials. This blog documents my ongoing efforts to model and design eco-friendly polysaccharide-based plastics using all-atom MD.

Thermoplastics have become some of the most widely used and indispensable materials in the modern world. They are used in everything from medical implants and drug delivery systems to toys, textiles, packaging, automotive parts, building materials, and even military-grade composites. As global plastic consumption continues to rise with a growing population, the need for renewable, sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics has become more urgent than ever. 

Fortunately, natural and engineered polysaccharides offer a vast and versatile feedstock for designing next-generation thermoplastics. Some have already demonstrated real-world potential, like cellulose triacetate (CTA), which was used in the production of LEGO bricks for decades. However, synthesizing novel glycomaterials with defined chemical structures remains a significant challenge. This is mainly due to the high density of chemically similar hydroxyl groups along the polysaccharide backbone, which complicates selective substitution using traditional protecting group strategies. These synthetic difficulties have motivated the development of computational approaches that can predict material properties as a function of chemical structure, helping to narrow the design space and accelerate the discovery of sustainable glycomaterial thermoplastics.

To that end, in this blog series, I use all-atom MD simulations with the GLYCAM06 force field in AMBER to predict thermo- and mechanical properties of an amorphous cellulose triacetate plastic. This is a living research project and will evolve over several months—expect drafts, breakthroughs, and the occasional setback. Thanks for joining me.


## Goals
- Successfully build and parameterize a system of 20 x CTA with DP=100.
- Equilibrate the system at 600 K to allow chain entanglement, and then cool down to 300 K to achieve a "realistic" starting configuration of an amorphous CTA plastic.
- Predict glass transition temperature and Young's modulus.
